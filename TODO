^--- candidate vere backend
     urbit in the browser

At this point, we have a working vere backend, as well as a full
"urbit in the browser".  Performance is unlikely to be as good as jaque,
but will likely be quite accepatable (especially for in-browser things).

At the very least, using an ivory pill to compile and run hoon from the
browser will ease client-side programming tasks.
